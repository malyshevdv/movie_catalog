movies catalog project

It small movie catalog using Postgresql as a data storage system. 

NOTE
it is not a complete solution. It is only for demonstration of my skills. And it is in the continuing development process.

I parse other movie catalogs and collect received data in our solution.
If you install our solution:
- Necessarily create a super admin user
- login into the system through localhost:8000 - login. The LOAD item will be on the left menu
- select the file to load from the back\mvcat\DATA catalog. The anime.txt for example.
- Press LOAD. movie-links will be loaded into the database.
- you may parse site links from movie catalogs for every movie manually, by pressing PARS ALL LOADED on the LOAD form.



The movie catalog provides you:
- look all lists of movies (+)
- let you group by type, movie genre, actors, year (+)
- let you analyze actors collaboration (-)
- have a more flexible search mechanism (-)
