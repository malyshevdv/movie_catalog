movies catalog project

It small movie catalog using postgresql as datastorage system. 

NOTE
it is not complitely solution. It is only for demonstartion of my skills. And it is beeing in the continuing developing process.

I parse other movies catalogs and collect received data in our solution.
If you install our solution:
- Necessarily create a superadmin user
- login in to the system thrue localhost:8000 - login. The LOAD item will be in the left menu
- select file to load from back\mvcat\DATA catalog. The anime.txt for example.
- press LOAD. movie-links will be loaded in the database .
- you may parse site-links from movie catalogs for every movies manualy, on press PARS ALL LOADED on the LOAD form.



The movie catalog provide you:
- look all list of movies (+)
- let you group by type, movie genre, actors, year (+)
- let you analize actors colaboration (-)
- have a more frexible search mechanism (-)
